# System-Level-Programming_Labs
This repository involves assingments from my System-Level Programming CSC3320 course and includes code programmed in C-language, shell script, and some Java. All of these projects were written my client terminal connected to a UNIX server.

Instructions to run code:

  C-Language-
  
    1. Copy code from the workspace
    2. Paste into a programming environment or .c file
    3. Compile the code (in UNIX use the command cc then the file name)
    4. Execute the a.out executable file (in UNIX prefix the a.out file with './')
    
  Shell Script-
    
    1. Copy the code from the workspace
    2. Open a shell scripting terminal
    3. Create a new script file with .sh postfix
    4. Paste the code into the scrpt file
    5. Set preferred permissions (in UNIX use the 'chmod' command)
    6. Execute at the shell script prefixed at the referenced pathname
       (Ex: If the .sh file is located in the home directory, prefix with './')

  Note: Some files need a paired text(.txt) file to run properly
